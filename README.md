# Real-Time Deepfake Detection for Video Streaming Platforms 

# Description:
          This project focuses on detecting DeepFake videos using deep learning techniques. It preprocesses video frames, extracts features, and classifies them as real or fake using a trained model

# Dataset:
The dataset is taken from the following source:
Source(Kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hungle3401/faceforensics/data

# Tools:
          * Python
          * OpenCV (for video frame extraction)
          * TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
          * NumPy & Pandas (for data manipulation)
